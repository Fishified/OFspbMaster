//Tips and Tricks -
/* I was having terrible trouble trying to get the 
simulation to start without the big block of central water that Jérémie 
had included in the first simulation. I wanted to only use the water 
surface profile from a Flow-3D run, but the solver kept crashing. This 
is how I fixed it:
 I set includeCut to true, and that is it. After I could run the simulation no problem.
